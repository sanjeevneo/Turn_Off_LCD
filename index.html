<p>Turn Off Display is a first-of-its-kind freeware that lets you turn off your Windows monitor screen in a click, without putting it to Sleep. This tool does not use a batch command. It uses a SendMessage Visual Basic command to send the  system, the command to turn off the display. Moreover, it is a portable tool that does not require to be installed. Nor does it ask you to download and install any specific .NET Framework version.</p>

<p>Simply download Turn off your LCD zip file, extract its contents, or download the latest release, move the folder to your Program Folder and pin the shortcut of Turn your LCD Off.exe to your Start Screen or Taskbar.</p>

<p>When you need to go away and want to turn off the screen, just click on its icon and the laptop monitor will be turned off. No need to lock Windows. This free tool does not put Windows to Sleep; it just turns off the screen.</p>

<p>When you want to turn on the screen, just move the mouse or touch the screen if your laptop has a touch-screen.</p>

<p>To create a Hotkey, right-click on its shortcut and select Properties. Under Shortcut tab, set a Shortcut key for it.</p>

<p>Turn Off Display does not have any UI – It works in the background. The tool is useful to have around, for your Windows or tablet, as it can also help you save power – especially when your device is running on battery.</p>
